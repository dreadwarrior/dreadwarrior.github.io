Discovered as three notebooks in an antique store in Rome at the turn of the 
millennium, The Reincarnationist Papers offers a tantalizing glimpse into the 
Cognomina, a secret society of people who possess total recall of their past 
lives.

Evan Michaels struggles with being different, with having the complete memories 
of two other people who lived sequentially before him. He fights loneliness and 
believes he is unique until he meets Poppy. She recognizes his struggle because 
she is like him, except that she is much older, remembering seven consecutive 
lives. But there is something else she must share with Evan—she is a member of 
the secretive Cognomina. They are, in effect, immortals—compiling experiences 
and skills over lifetimes into near superhuman abilities that they have used to 
drive history over centuries.

Poppy invites Evan into the Cognomina, but he must face their tests before 
entering this mysterious society as their equal.
