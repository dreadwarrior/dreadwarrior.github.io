Over the centuries, one small town in Germany has disappeared and never been 
resettled. Tom, a historian, and his theoretical physicist girlfriend Sharon, 
become interested. By all logic, the town should have survived. What's so 
special about Eifelheim?

Father Dietrich is the village priest of Eifelheim, in the year 1348, when the 
Black Death is gathering strength but is still not nearby. Dietrich is an 
educated man, and to his astonishment becomes the first contact person between 
humanity and an alien race from a distant star, when their ship crashes in the 
nearby forest. It is a time of wonders, in the shadow of the plague. Flynn gives 
us the full richness and strangeness of medieval life, as well as some terrific 
aliens.

Tom and Sharon, and Father Deitrich have a strange destiny of tragedy and 
triumph in Eifelheim, the brilliant science fiction novel by Michael Flynn.
