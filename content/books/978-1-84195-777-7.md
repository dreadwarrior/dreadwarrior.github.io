Deft and lyrical, Michel Faber's new collection of stories is his first since 
his auspicious debut, Some Rain Must Fall. It will seal his reputation as one of 
Britain's most daring and original authors. Acclaimed for his pitch-perfect prose 
and brilliant characterisation, Faber is also celebrated for his mastery of
contrasting styles.

From achingly sad lost lives of „The Safehouse“ through moments of exquisitely 
distilled happiness in „Vanilla-Bright Like Eminem“ to the biblical innocence 
and savagery of „The Fahrenheit Twins“, Faber's characters are redeemed, 
abandoned, beloved and laid bare. This is a book by a writer at the height of 
his powers.
