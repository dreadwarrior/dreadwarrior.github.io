Mallory Quinn is fresh out of rehab when she takes a job as a babysitter for Ted 
and Caroline Maxwell. She is to look after their five-year-old son, Teddy.

Mallory immediately loves it. She has her own living space, goes out for nightly 
runs, and has the stability she craves. And she sincerely bonds with Teddy, a 
sweet, shy boy who is never without his sketchbook and pencil. His drawings are 
the usual fare: trees, rabbits, balloons. But one day, he draws something 
different: a man in a forest, dragging a woman’s lifeless body.

Then, Teddy’s artwork becomes increasingly sinister, and his stick figures 
quickly evolve into lifelike sketches well beyond the ability of any 
five-year-old. Mallory begins to wonder if these are glimpses of a 
long-unsolved murder, perhaps relayed by a supernatural force.

Knowing just how crazy it all sounds, Mallory nevertheless sets out to decipher 
the images and save Teddy before it’s too late.
