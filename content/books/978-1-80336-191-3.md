Sherlock Holmes’s discovery of a mysterious musical score initiates a devious 
Christmas challenge set by Irene Adler, with clues that are all variations on 
the theme of ‘theft without theft’, such as a statue missing from a museum found 
hidden in the room it was taken from.

In the snowy London lead-up to Christmas, Holmes’s preoccupation with the “Adler 
Variations” risks him neglecting the case of his new client, Norwegian arctic 
explorer Fridtjof Nansen, who has received a series of threats in the form of 
animal carcasses left on his doorstep. Could they really be gifts from a strange 
spirit that has pursued Nansen since the completion of his expedition to cross 
Greenland? And might this case somehow be related to Irene Adler’s great game?
