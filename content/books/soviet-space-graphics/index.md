**A wonderful, whimsical journey through the pioneering space-race graphics of the 
former Soviet Union.**

This otherworldly collection of Soviet space-race graphics takes readers on a 
cosmic adventure through Cold War-era Russia. Created against a backdrop of 
geopolitical uncertainty, the extraordinary images featured, taken from the 
period's hugely successful popular-science magazines, were a vital tool for the 
promotion of state ideology. Presenting more than 250 illustrations - depicting 
daring discoveries, scientific innovations, futuristic visions, and 
extraterrestrial encounters - Soviet Space Graphics unlocks the door to the 
creative inner workings of the USSR.
