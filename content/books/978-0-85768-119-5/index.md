American professor George Magruder, his wife Louise and their daughter rent an 
old isolated house known as Trencherâ€™s Farm in Cornwall so George can finish 
his book. When George accidentally runs over a convicted child killer on the 
loose from a mental asylum, he confronts the brutal locals and sets in train a 
series of violent events that threatens his very survival and that of his 
family.
