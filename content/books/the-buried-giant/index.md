The Romans have long since departed, and Britain is steadily declining into 
ruin.

The Buried Giant begins as a couple, Axl and Beatrice, set off across a troubled 
land of mist and rain in the hope of finding a son they have not seen for years. 
They expect to face many hazards – some strange and other-worldly – but they 
cannot yet foresee how their journey will reveal to them dark and forgotten 
corners of their love for one another.
