Art photography meets popular culture in this behind-the-scenes look at the 
making of a hugely successful music video by musicians Die Antwoord and 
photographer Roger Ballen.

With more than 25 million hits and counting since its uploading on YouTube in 
2012, “I Fink You Freeky” has brought its director Roger Ballen, and its 
subject, rap group Die Antwoord, into the zeitgeist of young people around the 
globe. Shot in black-and white and featuring imagery, scenes, and subjects 
from Ballen’s stunning photographic work, the video, with its infectious beat 
and Die Antwoord’s ingenious blend of hip-hop, rap, and rave, has been a huge 
critical success. This book features the brilliant photography that inspired 
the collaboration between photographer and band, and shows how Ballen’s images 
became part of the finished project. In addition, shots from the filming of 
the video, and of band members in rehearsal and on the set, offer a 
fascinating glimpse of synergy in the making. Introduced by art critic Ivor 
Powell, this volume also features an interview between Ballen and the members 
of Die Antwood.
