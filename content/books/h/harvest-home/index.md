A family flees the crime-ridden city—and finds something worse.

After watching his asthmatic daughter suffer in the foul city air, Theodore 
Constantine decides to get back to the land. When he and his wife search New 
England for the perfect nineteenth-century home, they find no township more 
charming, no countryside more idyllic than the farming village of Cornwall 
Coombe. Here they begin a new life: simple, pure, close to nature—and ultimately 
more terrifying than Manhattan’s darkest alley.

When the Constantines win the friendship of the town matriarch, the mysterious 
Widow Fortune, they are invited to join the ancient festival of Harvest Home, a 
ceremony whose quaintness disguises dark intentions. In this bucolic hamlet, 
where bootleggers work by moonlight and all of the villagers seem to share the 
same last name, the past is more present than outsiders can fathom—and 
something far more sinister than the annual harvest is about to rise out of the 
earth.
