The peaceful alien invasion of Earth by the mysterious Overlords, whose arrival 
ends all war, helps form a world government, and turns the planet into a 
near-utopia.

Many questions are asked about the origins and mission of the aliens, but they 
avoid answering, preferring to remain in their ships, governing through indirect 
rule. Decades later, the Overlords eventually show themselves, and their impact 
on human culture leads to a Golden Age.

However, the last generation of children on Earth begin to display powerful 
psychic abilities, heralding their evolution into a group mind, a transcendent 
form of life.
