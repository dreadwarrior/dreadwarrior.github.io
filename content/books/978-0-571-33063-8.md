A trio of awkward teen boys... and one brilliant geek girl with a shattering 
secret.

An unexpected romance born on 8-bit computers and 5Â¼-inch floppy disks.

A daring and dangerous heist to steal the May 1987 issue of _Playboy Magazine_, 
featuring scandalous photographs of _Wheel of Fortune_ hostess Vanna White.

All of these elements collide in this coming-of-age crime caper that explores 
the timeless and ever-confusing realities of male adolescence.
