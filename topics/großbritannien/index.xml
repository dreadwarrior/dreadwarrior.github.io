Richard and Juliette Willoughby’s son,
Ewan, has died suddenly at the age of five. Convinced that the boy still lives
on in some form, and desparate to make contact, Juliette seeks the help of the
Beacons, a seemingly benevolent group of occultists. Whereas Ricahrd, an art
historian, tries to blot out the pain of his grief by turning his attention to
the field opposite their house, Starve Acre. Patiently he digs in the barren
soil looking for the roots of a legendary oak tree but unearths something which
ought to have remained buried.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
