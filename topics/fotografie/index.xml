making of a hugely successful music video by musicians Die Antwoord and
photographer Roger Ballen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With more than 25 million hits and counting since its uploading on YouTube in
2012, “I Fink You Freeky” has brought its director Roger Ballen, and its
subject, rap group Die Antwoord, into the zeitgeist of young people around the
globe. Shot in black-and white and featuring imagery, scenes, and subjects
from Ballen’s stunning photographic work, the video, with its infectious beat
and Die Antwoord’s ingenious blend of hip-hop, rap, and rave, has been a huge
critical success. This book features the brilliant photography that inspired
the collaboration between photographer and band, and shows how Ballen’s images
became part of the finished project. In addition, shots from the filming of
the video, and of band members in rehearsal and on the set, offer a
fascinating glimpse of synergy in the making. Introduced by art critic Ivor
Powell, this volume also features an interview between Ballen and the members
of Die Antwood.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
