## Decisions

### Decision: Use self-hosted Google Fonts

Currently, a wave of cease-and-desist letters is rolling over Germany. This may
affect website providers when loading Google Fonts from Google servers. To be
spared from this, the fonts and stylesheets were compiled and generated using
[google-webfonts-helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) and
are included in the VCS of this project.

The font packages are compiled by using the _latin_ charset only. The used
styles are constrained to the _regular_, _italic_, _700_ and _700italic_ if
available. For CSS generation the "Best Support" option was used.
